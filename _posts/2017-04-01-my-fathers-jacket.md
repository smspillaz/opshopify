Anglicare WA is thrilled to announce the opening of its brand new Op Shop in North Perth on Wednesday 4 May, 2016.

The new store is located at 392 Fitzgerald Street, in the middle of North Perth’s growing shopping and restaurant strip.

The shop specialises in vintage and quirky collectors’ items. Its stock includes a broad range of unique items said Isobel Macaulay, Retail Development Manager.

“We are excited to be opening this new store in North Perth. The vintage scene is really exploding in this area and our store should fit right in.

“We’ve focussed on acquiring some really interesting items and are very proud of our collection of retro homewares, vintage fashion and collector items.

“Many of these items are one-offs, so we are encouraging collectors and fashion aficionados to get in as quickly as possible to check out the wares,” said Ms Macaulay.

The proceeds from the store help to fund Anglicare WA’s services. Anglicare WA offers over 60 different community services that support vulnerable and disadvantaged Western Australians with issues ranging from homelessness, to financial stress to domestic violence.

“You can support a great cause while hunting for treasures,” said Ms Macaulay.

A private launch will be held the day before the opening.
